# Take-Home-Pay-Calculator
Worked in a group to create a tax caculator that could calculate an individual's take home pay using the tax rules set in June 2020
- It works for salaries ranging from £1 to £10 million
- It allows the user to compare two differnt salaries
- It automatically assumes the user has a student loan
- It doesn't include an option for a user who has no student loans
